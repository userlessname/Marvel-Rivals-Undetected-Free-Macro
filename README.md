Hi, my name is userlessname.

Rev 2 is the first interaction with you i will fix bugs if there is any along the way, please do not forget to tell me by replying the post.

This is an auto skill trigger macro rev 2. it is free. i will also share source code in this one. all thing converted into python because of the better image search results. mouse and keyboard send through a driver. rev 2 is much precise.

How to run:
1. install driver in "inter installation" folder by running bat file as admin.

2. Your screen resolution must be 1920x1080 (i may add others)

3. In game Settings>Accessibility>Hp Bar Color must be Blue, making Shield Hp Bar Color Blue also helps. (i may add others)

4. For hulk jump to be work "hold to active incrediable leap" must be on (default), also Captain America's Hold to Raise Shield must be off (not default). And also i suggest you to turn off Captain America's "Hold to Dash"

5. expand the hero you want and check the check box you want to activate, slider is for min hp to send skill.

Defence:
Hulk (Indestructible Guard) (Jump (does not need hp check))
Captain America (Living Legen)
Venom (Symbiotic Resilience)
Magneto (Iron Bulwark) (Metallic Curtain)
Thor (Lightning Realm)

Attack:
Scarlet Witch (Mystic Projection)
Namor (Blessing of The Deep)
Psylocke (Psychic Stealth)
Wolverine (Undying Animal)
Mister Fantastic (Reflexive Rubber)

Healer:
Loki (Deception)
Mantis (Natural Anger)
Rocket Raccoon (Repair Mode)
Luna Snow (Ice Arts)
Adam Warlock (Avatar Life Stream)
Jeff The Land Shark (Hide and Seek)
Invisible Woman (Double Jump(invisible(heal)))

How it is works:
1. It will automatically get mouse and keyboard device handles to use only in program at the start of the program.
2. It will automatically get your key layout.
3. It will automatically and constantly makes screen search for things to send skill when life is low.
