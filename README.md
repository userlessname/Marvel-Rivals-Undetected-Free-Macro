# Marvel Rivals Undetected/Safe Free Macro 0108

Helloooo,

i just made marvel rivals macro with Autohotkey v2 and AutoHotInterception.
Did not use any kind of detection from ram, window, game file, security file etc.
Safe as it gets.

Macro gets your mouse and keyboard handle and send inputs throught them and make image search from your screen, just these. Because of these, there are somethings that you have to do manualy, that i will explain in a sec.

Auto ability trigger at certain hp that you chose, This macro is not a one click team wipe, but it is a huge quality of life improvement.

## Very important:
Folder need to be a path with only english in it, if your user has not english word, you can not extract to your desktop. extract to c, d etc. If only your desktop folder is not english, Press Win + R, type regedit -> HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders -> Find the entry named "Desktop" and double-click it. -> Change your desktop name

## How to use it:
**1. Install Phython:**

https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.13.1/python-3.13.1-amd64.exe

**2. Extraction:**

   * Extract the contents of the downloaded zip file to a folder of your choice.

**3. Install Interception Driver (if you do not have it):**

   * Navigate to the "interception installation" folder.
   * Run `Run As Admin - Install.bat` **as administrator**.
   * **Restart your computer** after installation.

**4. Screen Resolution:**

   * Your primary monitor's resolution **must be 1920x1080**.
   * I have not test multiple monitor setups
   * (Support for other resolutions may be added in the future).

**5. In-Game Accessibility Settings:**

   * Go to **Settings > Accessibility**.
   * Set **HP Bar Color** to **Blue**.
   * Setting **Shield HP Bar Color** to **Blue** is also recommended for optimal performance. 
   * (Support for other colors may be added in the future).

**6. Initial Program Start:**

   * Upon the first launch of the macro script, you need to **move your mouse and press a key** on your keyboard. This allows the script to capture the necessary input handles.

**7. Toggling the Macro:**

   * The macro has an **on/off switch** controlled by pressing **`Alt + 1`**.
   * The default state is "on." Pressing the hotkey will toggle it.
   * You should see an **on-screen notification** in the center of your screen indicating the current state.
   * **If you don't see the notification:** The DLL might be blocked by your system.
     * Navigate to the "Lib" folder.
     * Run `Unblocker.ps1` **as administrator**.
     * **Restart your computer** to ensure the changes are applied.
    
**8. Additional Macros(testing):**

  * **`Ctrl + 1`** disable additional macros
  * **`Ctrl + 2`** constant mouse left button click
  * **`Ctrl + 3`** constant mouse left + right button click
  * **`Ctrl + 4`** mouse right button hold for Adam Warlock

**9. Running the Macro:**

   * After completing all the steps, open the macro program and launch Marvel Rivals.
   * In the macro interface:
     * **Select the hero** you want to use the macro with.
     * **Choose the specific ability** for the macro.
     * **Adjust the slider** to set the **minimum HP percentage** at which the ability will be automatically activated.
     * Ensure the **"Auto send"** option is enabled.

**10. Suggestions:**
   * Captain america works better with 
     * "Hold to Raise Shield" OFF (not default)
     * "Hold to Dash" OFF (not default)
   * Hulk works better with
     * "Hold to Activate Incredible Leap" ON (default)
