Helloooo,

i just made marvel rivals macro with Autohotkey v2 and AutoHotInterception.
Did not use any kind of detection from ram, window, game file, security file etc.
Safe as it gets.

Macro gets your mouse and keyboard handle and send inputs throught them and make image search from your screen, just these. Because of these, there are somethings that you have to do manualy, that i will explain in a sec.

This macro is not a one click team wipe, but it is a huge quality of life improvement.

## How to use it:

**1. Extraction:**

   * Extract the contents of the downloaded zip file to a folder of your choice.

**2. Install Interception Driver (if needed):**

   * Navigate to the "interception installation" folder.
   * Run `Run As Admin - Install.bat` **as administrator**.
   * **Restart your computer** after installation.

**3. Screen Resolution:**

   * Your primary monitor's resolution **must be 1920x1080**.
   * I have not test multiple monitor setups
   * (Support for other resolutions may be added in the future).

**4. Game Display Mode:**

   * Set your game to **Borderless Window** mode.

**5. In-Game Accessibility Settings:**

   * Go to **Settings > Accessibility**.
   * Set **HP Bar Color** to **Blue**.
   * Setting **Shield HP Bar Color** to **Blue** is also recommended for optimal performance. 
   * (Support for other colors may be added in the future).

**6. Keybind Layout**

   * For now you have to use my key layout
   * Navigate to **Settings > Keyboard > Combat**.
   * Configure your keybinds as follows:
     * **Secondary Attack:** Right Mouse Button
     * **Ability 1:** Middle Mouse Button
     * **Ability 2:** E
     * **Ability 3:** F
     * **(Optional)** Ultimate: Left Shift (LShift)
     * **(Optional)** Ping: Q
     * **(Optional)** Melee: V
   * (Support for custom key layouts may be added in the future).

**7. Hero-Specific Settings:**

   * **Hulk:** Ensure "Hold to activate Incredible Leap" is **ON** (default).
   * **Captain America:** Ensure "Hold to Raise Shield" is **OFF** (not default). It is also suggested to turn **OFF** "Hold to Dash."

**8. Initial Program Start:**

   * Upon the first launch of the macro script, you need to **move your mouse and press a key** on your keyboard. This allows the script to capture the necessary input handles.

**9. Toggling the Macro:**

   * The macro has an **on/off switch** controlled by pressing **`Ctrl + 1`**.
   * The default state is "on." Pressing the hotkey will toggle it.
   * You should see an **on-screen notification** in the center of your screen indicating the current state.
   * **If you don't see the notification:** The DLL might be blocked by your system.
     * Navigate to the "Lib" folder.
     * Run `Unblocker.ps1` **as administrator**.
     * **Restart your computer** to ensure the changes are applied.

**10. Running the Macro:**

   * After completing all the steps, open the macro program and launch Marvel Rivals.
   * In the macro interface:
     * **Select the hero** you want to use the macro with.
     * **Choose the specific ability** for the macro.
     * **Adjust the slider** to set the **minimum HP percentage** at which the ability will be automatically activated.
     * Ensure the **"Auto send"** option is enabled.

Hulk is the best use case, honestly hulk is unusable without this macro.
It makes hulk s tier. Healers are good in general term, especially raccoon and mantis. Wolverine becomes good for fast paced action.
